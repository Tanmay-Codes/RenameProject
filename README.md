#Rename Thousands of files of any type in a folder as per your desired prefixes or postfixes with the ability to add current date of modificaiton

- This is a GUI based application
- It takes the input as the path of the destination folder with the files grouping in them
- Then it works same as the find and replace method, to correct any string of the file names or to add any prefix or postfix to the file name, all at once.
- A reset button is added to reset the files back to original name
- Add date button is added to add the date in the end of the file.

The complete project has its highlight of, not just making a simple GUI based Rename app, but to make an executable dirttibutable file that can be installed in any system and could serve its purpose well
